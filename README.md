Quick repository to explore Forward Error Correction methods

# Inspiration

This work is inspired by a 'diptych' of 3Blue1Brown videos on Hamming codes, which I encourage you to watch, as they give a very clear intuition.

Part 1 introduces how Hamming came up with error correction, part 2 describes an elegant (bare-bones) Python implementation based on XOR. It will be the starting point of this repo.
